# KenvueForecasting

This project is intended only for portfolio purposes, please do not try to download this project or change it on your own system. I have purposefully removed lines of code which are private and cannot be shared. This project was completed in an internship at Kenvue, where I looked at forecasting and wanted to help various stakeholders within the company interact and understand data better. This project demonstrates my proficiency in React and in Python. The backend is a flask server, and the frontend is React. The intended purpose of the platform is to be able to input a spreadsheet, send data to the backend server for configuration, redirect the page to display the relevant graphs. I used external React libraries to create a better user experience.

Below are videos to display the intended purposes of the website.

In addition to the user being able to directly increase/decrease all forecasting values, the platform intended to display the changed statistics of the new data as well as also be able to rotate the average forecast line so as to display a steady increase/decrease, this part of the project has not been displayed below.
